Some of the information are alraedy in other's youtubers channels or on the internet so I put the link here to get their info. However I added new things.

Here the library I used to get the temperature sensor , because using the common performance monitor did not work. https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/1115618/CPU-Temperature-System-Information http://openhardwaremonitor.org/

Here the example I took from youtube for performance checking, it is very well explained. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=niKP91D50Ko this is ok. good explanation  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCxiaLLhnNU

Check the video, I explained the most important thing to make it work. https://youtu.be/5gXlG3OrNCQ

Note: I do not explain in detail how things work but I tried to make it understandable so you can use it for learning purposes.
